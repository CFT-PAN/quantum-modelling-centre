# About the code platform

This code platform featuring open codes and models was developed as part of the EUCENTRAL project (Horizon Europe project no. 101186579). It will serve as a testing environment for both theoretical concepts and technological solutions. It will enable the evaluation of the feasibility of new technological ideas before proceeding to experimental trials and implementations. 

It’s designed as a user-friendly environment, showcasing software capabilities and modelling skills, to foster interest in the field and pave the way for new research and collaboration. The website includes the Research Software section, featuring software packages, and the Tutorial section, featuring tutorials on software development. Apart from these, we’re also including an Example problems section, along with proposed solutions, to teach you how to use these in practice.

**Center for Theoretical Physics of the Polish Academy of Sciences**, est. 1980, is an autonomous research institution, hosting researchers from various disciplines related to theoretical physics, astrophysics, and natural studies. It employs ca. 60 researchers and implemented grants from ERA Chair, ERC, the Polish National Science Centre, Templeton Foundation, Maria Skłodowska-Curie Actions, the PL-NO GRIEG project. CTP PAS is one of the three most cited Polish physics research institutions and its employees are acclaimed in their fields, and received the Prize of the Foundation for Polish Science. Apart from research activity, CTP PAS members take part in the popularisation of science, have founded several popular science initiatives, and are frequent experts and commentators on the media.

CTP PAS is the institution implementing the EUCENTRAL grant and its principal investigator, the host of the Quantum Modelling Center, located in Warsaw, Poland.

# About EUCENTRAL project

![cft]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/EU_central_logo.png){: style="width: 300px; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;"}

**EUCENTRAL** is a Horizon Europe project (no. 101186579) and part of the ERA Chairs call. Its chief goal is to increase an institution’s research capacity, coordinated by a world-renowned senior researcher - an ERA Chair holder. 

EUCENTRAL is coordinated by Prof. Marzena Szymańska, ERA Chair, one of the leading figures in quantum modelling, and managed by Dr. Anna Raiter-Smiljanic. Its Advisory Board includes Prof. Maciej Lewenstein, Prof. Artur Ekert, Prof. Andrew Daley, and Prof. Krzysztof Pawłowski. 

The objectives of EUCENTRAL include: 

- Reforming the institute by creating the Research Support Center and introducing new policies and effective procedures in HR, gender balance, and commercialisation,
- Strengthening R&I potential, increasing mobility of CTP PAS by creating a permanent and excellent international Modelling for Quantum Technologies group for brain gain,
- Developing methods for many-body open quantum systems for the emerging quantum technologies to position CTP PAS among world leaders in modelling for quantum technologies,
- Developing excellence capacity and expanded resources within Poland and internationally via setting up a platform for software for quantum systems modelling,
- Communicating R&I results and experience to all stakeholders inside and outside Poland to contribute to Europe’s competitiveness and growth.
