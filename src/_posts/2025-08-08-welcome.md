Welcome to the website of the Quantum Modelling Center, established at the Center for Theoretical Physics of the Polish Academy of Sciences as part of the EUCENTRAL project (Horizon Europe project no. 101186579).

The website will serve as an easy to use, user-friendly repository for research software and software development tutorials produced during the project. The content is available free of charge to all visitors and meant to both document our progress and to spark collaboration in the field.
